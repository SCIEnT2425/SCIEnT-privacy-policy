  <h1>Privacy Policy for SCIEnT Application</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 17th July 2025</p>

  <p>The SCIEnT Application is a digital platform developed and managed by the SCIEnT Innovation Hub at NIT Trichy. The app is designed to streamline and manage interactions between registered students of NIT Trichy and the SCIEnT facility, including but not limited to space allocation, activity planning, and administrative oversight.</p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect the personal and organizational data of users, including club representatives and administrators, when they interact with the SCIEnT App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>We collect only essential information required for club access and facility management.</p>

  <h3>1.1 User Credentials</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Username and Password: Each club and admin is assigned a hardcoded username and password to access the app. These can be changed by the user after initial login.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Activity Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Day and time of requested facility use</li>
    <li>Purpose or reason for request</li>
    <li>Number of participants</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 System and Technical Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Booking timestamp and activity log (for tracking usage)</li>
    <li>Basic device and app version data (for improvement purposes)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Authenticating users based on hardcoded credentials</li>
    <li>Tracking club room usage and request frequency</li>
    <li>Managing weekly usage limits (e.g., 14 credits per week per club)</li>
    <li>Facilitating SCIEnT administrator review and approval processes</li>
    <li>Improving app functionality and ensuring smooth operation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All user and booking data are securely stored on a protected backend (hosted via Railway or similar service).</li>
    <li>Passwords are stored in hashed format, and users can change their password from within the app.</li>
    <li>Data access is restricted to SCIEnT administrative personnel and authorized developers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. No Use of Third-Party Authentication</h2>
  <p>Unlike some apps, we currently do not use third-party services like Firebase for authentication. All usernames and passwords are managed internally, and no data is shared with third-party authentication providers.</p>

  <h2>5. User Control and Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Log in and access your dashboard</li>
    <li>Change your password</li>
    <li>View and manage your activity requests</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data by contacting the SCIEnT Admin team</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Booking and activity records are stored for the duration of the academic year for institutional planning and review.</li>
    <li>User credentials remain stored unless explicitly deleted or changed by the SCIEnT admin team.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The SCIEnT App is intended exclusively for verified student clubs and administrators at NITT. It’s not designed for or intended to be used by individuals under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>8. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy periodically to reflect improvements or changes in the application. Continued use of the app after such updates implies acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
